# Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions when using Harukit CLI.

## Common Issues

### Component Not Found

**Error:** `Component 'button' not found`

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're using the latest version: `npx harukit@latest`
2. Check available components: `npx harukit@latest list`
3. Verify the component name is spelled correctly

### Import Error

**Error:** `Cannot resolve module '@/components/button'`

**Solution:**
1. Ensure the component was added successfully
2. Check that the import path matches your configuration
3. Verify your `tsconfig.json` has the correct path mappings:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Styling Issues

**Problem:** Components don't look styled correctly

**Solution:**
1. Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured
2. Check that CSS variables are defined in your global styles
3. Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` includes the necessary paths:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  ],
  // ... rest of config
}
```

### Package Manager Detection Failed

**Error:** `Failed to detect package manager`

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you have a `package.json` file in your project root
2. Ensure you're using a supported package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun)
3. The CLI will automatically detect your package manager and install dependencies

### Dependencies Not Installed

**Problem:** Required dependencies are missing

**Solution:**
1. Harukit automatically installs all required dependencies during initialization
2. If installation fails, try running the init command again
3. Check that your package manager is working correctly
4. Verify you have proper permissions to install packages

### TypeScript Errors

**Error:** TypeScript compilation errors

**Solution:**
1. Ensure TypeScript is properly configured
2. Check that all required types are installed
3. Verify your `tsconfig.json` includes the correct settings
4. Make sure you're using compatible versions of React and TypeScript

### Next.js App Router Issues

**Problem:** Components don't work in Next.js App Router

**Solution:**
1. Make sure to import the global CSS in your `app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
import './globals.css'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

2. Verify your project structure follows Next.js App Router conventions

### Permission Denied

**Error:** `Permission denied` when running commands

**Solution:**
1. Check file permissions in your project directory
2. Ensure you have write access to the project folder
3. Try running the command with appropriate permissions
4. On Unix systems, you might need to use `sudo` (though this is not recommended)

### Network Errors

**Error:** Network-related errors during installation

**Solution:**
1. Verify your internet connection
2. Check if your network allows npm/yarn/pnpm/bun registry access
3. Try using a different network or VPN
4. Clear your package manager cache:
   - npm: `npm cache clean --force`
   - yarn: `yarn cache clean`
   - pnpm: `pnpm store prune`
   - bun: `bun pm cache rm`
